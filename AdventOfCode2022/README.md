# Advent Of Code - 2022
This is where I dump all the various days of work to "show off"

Templates - This is my base file that I use per day.
Helpers - As I create new helper functions, I stick them in the Helpers file that I include each day.

- **Day 1**: Basic logic, hadn't really sorted out how I wanted to do initialization and helper functions, so everything is manually copied.
- **Day 2**: Same
- **Day 3**: Same
- **Day 4**: Same, but a little clean-up
- **Day 5**: Split the helper file into a unique file that gets included each time, so I can make changes to one file and every future day gets the updates
- **Day 6**: Same, and added a function for splitting strings by a number.
